## 📊 Web Scraping Simulation for Product Reviews (Python)
## 📌 Project Overview

- This project demonstrates a Web Scraping Simulation approach to extract and structure e-commerce product review data using Python.
Due to scraping restrictions on real-world websites (like Amazon blocking automated requests), the project uses simulated scraping techniques that closely replicate real web scraping workflows.

- The dataset structure, pagination logic, and review attributes are designed to mirror real-world scraped data, making the project industry-relevant and portfolio-ready.

## 🎯 Objectives

-Simulate web scraping of product reviews

-Structure review data in a clean and analyzable format

-Generate a dataset suitable for further data analysis and visualization

-Export the extracted data into CSV and Excel formats

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas

- Random

- Datetime

- Google Colab

- OpenPyXL

- tqdm

## 📂 Dataset Description

- The dataset simulates product review data commonly found on e-commerce platforms.

- 📑 Columns Included:

- Title – Review title

- Review – Customer review text

- Rating – Product rating (1.0 to 5.0)

- Verified – Verified purchase status (Yes/No)

- Date – Review date

- Image_URL – Product image URL

- Review_Length – Number of characters in the review

- Review_Length_Category – Short / Medium / Long

- Sentiment – Positive / Neutral / Negative (based on rating)

- Helpful_Votes – Simulated helpful vote count

- Product – Product name

## 🔄 Methodology

- Simulated multiple product reviews using Python

- Generated realistic ratings, dates, and verification status

- Applied feature engineering:

- Review length calculation

- Sentiment classification based on rating

- Review length categorization

- Structured data using Pandas DataFrame

- Exported final dataset to CSV and Excel formats

## 📈 Output Files

- dummy_reviews_advanced_final.csv

- dummy_reviews_advanced_final.xlsx

- These files can be directly used for:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Data Visualization

- Machine Learning tasks

## 🚀 Future Scope

Apply data visualization techniques (Task 2)

Perform sentiment analysis using NLP

Train machine learning models for review classification

Integrate real-time scraping using APIs or paid proxies

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

Understanding real-world web scraping challenges

Handling structured data using Pandas

Feature engineering for text-based datasets

Preparing clean datasets for analytics and ML workflows
